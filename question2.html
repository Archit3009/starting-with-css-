    <h3>
        i have named different paragraphs BEM naming conventions.
    </h3>
    <H4>
        THE BEM NAMING CONVENTIONS HAVE 3 PARTS
    </H4>
    <ol>
        <li>The block name: This is the name of the element that the class is styling. In this case, the block name is "paragraph".</li>
        <li>The element name: This is the name of the specific part of the element that the class is styling. In this case, the element name is "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", or "7", depending on the paragraph.</li>
        <li>The modifier name: This is a name that is added to the class to indicate a specific variation of the element. In this case, there are no modifier names, because each paragraph is unique.</li>
    </ol>
